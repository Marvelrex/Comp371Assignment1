Project Part I

* Render 5 Models, 128*128 grid, x-y-z axis in 3D space.
* Operation can be done by keyboard and mouse.
* Focused on Matrix transformation, Hierarchy Models, Camera , Input Handle.


You can See:

* Four models are to be placed on quarter arcs of a circle touching the imaginary edges of the grid and one model facing along the x-axis as required. 
* 128*128 girds in yellow color.
* RGB xyz axes located at origin.


### Operation

Project1 used keyboard and mouse as input:

* [1] Bind model 1 and activated. Camera position in the center showing Zuhaad bin Aabid (40085293) letters and digits model.(Activated means you can do the operations to the model)
* [2] Bind model 2 and activated. Camera position in the right side showing Shi Xuan Deng (40057454) letters and digits model.
* [3] Bind model 3 and activated. Camera position in the bottom side showing YeeHo Chow (40032218) letters and digits model.
* [4] Bind model 4 and activated. Camera position in the left side showing Nick Léveillée (40130986) letters and digits model.
* [5] Bind model 5 and activated. Camera position in the top side showing Jialin Yang(40069006) letters and digits model.
* [W] - Move model to the positive x-axis.
* [A] - Move model to the negative z-axis.
* [S] - Move model to the negative x-axis.
* [D] - Move model to the positive z-axis.
* [W][A] Model moves diagonaly top left.
* [W][D] Model moves diagonaly top right.
* [S][A] Model moves diagonaly bottom left.
* [S][D] Model moves diagonaly bottom right.
* [SHIFT + A] Rotate model left 5 degrees.
* [SHIFT + D] Rotate model right 5 degrees.
* [U] - Scale up the model
* [J] - Scale down the model
* [T] - Change render type to GL_TRIANGLES
* [L] - Change render type to GL_LINE_LOOP
* [P] - Change render type to GL_POINTS
* [UP ARROW] Anti-clockwise rotation about positive y axis.
* [DOWN ARROW] Anti-clockwise rotation about negative y axis.
* [LEFT ARROW] Anti-clockwise rotation about positive x axis.
* [RIGHT ARROW] Anti-clockwise rotation about negative x axis.
* [Mouse Left Button] Use mouse movement to move into/out of the scene
* [Mouse Middle Button] Use mouse movement in the y direction to tilt.
* [Mouse Right Button] Use mouse movement in the x direction to pan
* [Home] Reset all model and world to inital setting.
